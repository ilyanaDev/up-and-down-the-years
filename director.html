            Hi, I'm Ilyana, and I'm so glad you've come to the website for <i>Up and Down the Years</i>!
            <br>
            <br>
            I started working on this project in late 2017 and finished it over two years later in the final months of 2019. As I'd never done anything like this before, the process of creating <i>Up and Down the Years</i> was long and at times confusing, but I'm pleased with the story I was able to tell in the final result. Although I've been dancing with the German Family Society of Akron (which was founded by Donauschwaben immigrants) since I was three years old, I knew very little about the Donauschwaben until I started work on this documentary. Needless to say, I learned a lot, and I'm happy to be able to share it with you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Up and Down the Years</i> is the product of dozens of people's generosity of time and of spirit. Thank you to everyone who made this journey possible. Enjoy the show.
            <br>
