            Anna Koenig lived in a small town in Yugoslavia until she was eight years old. When World War II ended, she and her family fled to Austria due to the ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Yugoslavia after the war. Soon they were told it was safe to return home to Yugoslavia. Unfortunately this was not the case, and she and her family were put into concentration camps for the next three and a half years. After they were released from the camps, they returned home. Years later, when she met her husband at the age of nineteen, they decided to move to America, and Frau Koenig has lived in Akron, Ohio ever since.
