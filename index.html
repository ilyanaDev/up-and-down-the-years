        <i>Up and Down the Years</i> is the story of the Donauschwaben, a German-speaking ethnic group who lived in Yugoslavia and other areas of southeastern Europe in the centuries leading up to World War II. Following the war, the Donauschwaben were expelled from their homes. They fled around the world, eventually settling into new homes. Today the Donauschwaben are dedicated to maintaining their heritage through cultural clubs, dance, and festivals.
