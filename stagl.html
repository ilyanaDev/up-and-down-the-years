            Anna Stagl was born in Ruma, a German community in Yugoslavia. She lived there until her family was forced out following World War II, when she was six years old. After living in displaced peopleâ€™s camps in Germany and Austria for a few years, she traveled with her family to America in 1950. She attended school in northeast Ohio from the fifth grade onwards. She was a member of the German Family Society of Akron since its founding and remains active in the club.
